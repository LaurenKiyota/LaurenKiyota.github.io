    <h2>Thinking Differently</h2>
    <p>Kimberlé Crenshaw came across a 1976 case regarding several Black women who were laid off from General Motors. They argued that the combination of their race and their gender
      resulted in compound discrimination. The courts disagreed, saying that since Black men were not laid off and white women were not laid off, there was no such thing as compound
      discrimination.</p>
    <p>Crenshaw coined the term intersectionality to describe the unique set of social experiences that individuals have due to the combination of their race, class, gender, sexuality,
      and more.</p>
    <p>After I learned about Kimberlé Crenshaw and intersectionality, the way I look at the world and other people has changed. I have become more thoughtful and considerate in my
      interactions and thinking.</p>
