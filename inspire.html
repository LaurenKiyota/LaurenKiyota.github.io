    <h2>Thinking Differently</h2>
    <p>Kimberle Crenshaw came across a 1976 case regarding several Black women who were laid off from General Motors. They argued that the combination of their race and their gender<br>
      resulted in compound discrimination. The courts disagreed, saying that since Black men were not laid off and white women were not laid off, there was no such thing as compound<br>
      discrimination.</p>
    <p>Crenshaw coined the term intersectionality to describe the unique set of social experiences that individuals have due to the combination of their race, class, gender, sexuality,<br>
      and more.</p>
